Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Python, Linear Regression (Machine Learning), Nodemailer

Developed a full-stack intelligent blood donation platform that connects donors, hospitals, and recipients in real time. 
Integrated ML-based Linear Regression model (Python) to predict donor eligibility based on donation frequency, health data, 
and recency. Users and hospitals can search donors by blood type and location. Enabled secure registration/login, email alerts
